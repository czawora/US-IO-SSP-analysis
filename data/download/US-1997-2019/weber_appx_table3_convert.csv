Note:,,,,,,,,,
This table summarizes the main results of simulated price shocks using the Leontief price model for all industries.,,,,,,,,,Each row
"provides the overall inflation impact (total, direct, and indirect) resulting from a simulated price shock to an individual industry.",,,,,,,,,
"For each industry, three different magnitudes of price shocks are used: (1) the average sectoral price volatility of the industry over",,,,,,,,,
"the period 2000-2019, (2) the annual price change of the industry from 2020-Q4 to 2021-Q4 (the post-shudown period), and (3)",,,,,,,,,
the annual price change of the industry from 2021-Q2 to 2022-Q2 (the period which includes the 2022-Q2 price shock resulting,,,,,,,,,
"from the beginning of the war in Ukraine). The magnitude of the price shocks for each of the three scenarios is given. In addition,",,,,,,,,,
"each industry’s ranking among the 71 industries in terms of forward linkages is provided, as is the industry’s ranking in terms of",,,,,,,,,
the overall inflation impact for each of the three price shocks. The industries are arranged in descending order according to their,,,,,,,,,
inflation impact when we simulate the sectoral price volatility as a shock to the industry.,,,,,,,,,
